# Intuit Assignment – Python Data Analysis & Concurrency

This repository contains **two independent Python mini-projects**:

1. **Online Retail Sales Analysis (UCI)** – a functional, stream-based data analysis CLI.
2. **Producer–Consumer Concurrency Demo** – a classic multithreaded producer–consumer implementation using a bounded blocking queue.

Each project lives in its own folder and has its **own `README.md`** with full details on design, setup, and usage.
